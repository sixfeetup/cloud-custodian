      Find users who are both enabled AND guest users.
      This policy demonstrates multiple filter conditions (AND logic).
      This typically returns fewer results since most guests are managed differently.
    filters:
      - type: value
        key: accountEnabled
        value: true
      - type: value
        key: userType
        value: Guest
