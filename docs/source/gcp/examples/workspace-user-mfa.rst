Workspace Users - find users without MFA
========================================

Google Workspace (Cloud Identity) users are not GCP resources. They
are read through the Admin SDK Directory API, which differs from the
rest of the GCP provider in two ways: it is scoped to a Workspace
account, called a "customer", rather than a project, and it is
authorized by domain wide delegation rather than by GCP IAM::

The service account lives in a GCP project. The users, and the user whose
``Users > Read`` privilege is borrowed to read them, live in the Workspace.
The GCP service account is connected to the Workspace using
domain-wide-delegation configuration in the Workspace, so the service account
can live in any project. Which user it impersonates is chosen at run time by
``GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_SUBJECT``.

Setup needed to use these resources
-----------------------------------

You need a GCP service account that a Workspace super administrator has
authorized for the ``admin.directory.user.readonly`` scope, and a Workspace
user for it to impersonate. The impersonated user needs only the
``Users > Read`` privilege, not super admin.

Then, when running policies, the following environment variables must be set:

``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS``
  Path to a service account key file. A key is required because delegation self signs
  a JWT.

``GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_SUBJECT``
  The Workspace user with the ``Users > Read`` privilege to
  impersonate. Delegation is only attempted when this is set.

In addition, you may need:

``GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CUSTOMER``
  Optional customer (Workspace account) id. Defaults to
  ``my_customer``, which resolves to the customer (Workspace) the
  impersonated subject belongs to, so the usual single Workspace case
  needs no configuration. Set it when the subject can administer more
  than one customer, or to pin the target explicitly.

A run targets one customer, so scanning several means several runs. Because
the resource is customer scoped rather than project scoped, it should be
excluded from per project sweeps, which would otherwise report the same
users once per project.

Finding users without MFA
-------------------------

The Directory API reports 2 step verification, Google's term for MFA, per
user. This satisfies CIS-B-GCPF-4.0.0-1.2. Suspended users cannot sign in,
so they are excluded to avoid noise.

.. code-block:: yaml

    policies:
      - name: gcp-workspace-users-without-mfa
        description: |
          Workspace users that have not enrolled in 2 step verification.
        resource: gcp.workspace-user
        filters:
          - type: value
            key: isEnrolledIn2Sv
            value: false
          - type: value
            key: suspended
            value: false

Caveats
-------

``isEnrolledIn2Sv`` and ``isEnforcedIn2Sv`` report whether a second factor is
present or required, not which type it is. The Directory user resource does
not expose security key information, so security key enforcement cannot be
audited through this resource.

``isAdmin`` denotes a Workspace *super* administrator. Users holding
a narrower delegated role appear as ``isDelegatedAdmin`` instead, and neither
is the same as a GCP ``roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin`` binding.

If your organization authenticates through an external identity provider,
MFA may be enforced there rather than by Google, in which case
``isEnrolledIn2Sv`` can read false for users who are in fact strongly
authenticated.
